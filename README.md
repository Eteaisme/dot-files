### philosophy
- What do I want system to do?
  - Most things should be accesable from a hotkey. For example, searching something on google should not require menu --> Google.
  - If things need to go through an agent it should be through the temrinal if possible. For example, if file explorer is not dirrectly oppened with keybind it should be terminal then file explorer first.
  - Things should take up most screenspace as possible and tiles should feel smooth.
  - Things should be kept minimal and de-bloated. .config should only contain configs of what I need anything else required should go through .config/misc.
  - Different applications should float vs, fullscreen. Fullscreen requires full atention floating is --> means to an end (think rofi)
  - System should provide valluble information, strip what wont be used. For example, Im not really concerned with my cpu heat but things like the weather and what media is playing is usefull.
  - Notifactions --> (Never really got into this, seems like an important aspect of ricing but I don't really know what I want since I haven't tiried anything).
